future engenieers
===
our projet consist in making an automated land vehicle that is capable of navigate in an environment marked by colored obstacles taking different paths in function of the obstacle colour, we use a arduino based program(c++) that have a code composed by ultrasonic sensors that are capable of receving signal at a pre-established distance then it sends a signal to the arduino circuit board which will indicate to the vehicle movement system where to go, clockwise or counterclockwise, as pre-established. It aloo have a camera module(name of the camera) to detect a colored obstacle an evade it depending of the colour
the code have different rutines depending on :
